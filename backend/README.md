- Batch test case execution with comprehensive result interpretation  
- Submission history tracking with performance metrics  

### 🚦 Rate Limiting & Security
- Custom sliding window rate limiting using Redis  
- Protection against DDoS and brute-force attacks  
- Different limits for various operations:  
  - 5 login attempts per 15 minutes  
  - 10 code submissions per minute  
  - Admin operation limits  

### 🤖 AI-Powered Assistance
- Google Gemini integration for doubt solving  
- Context-aware responses strictly focused on current problem  
- Multiple assistance modes (hints, code review, solutions)  
- Beautifully formatted code responses with dark theme  

### 🎥 Video Solutions
- Cloudinary integration for video storage  
- Direct frontend upload with secure signed requests

- Automatic thumbnail generation and duration tracking  

### 📊 User Management
- User profile system with solved problems tracking  
- Compound indexes for efficient querying  
- Admin capabilities for user management  

## 🗂️ API Structure


### Authentication Routes
- POST `/user/register` – Register a new user and issue a JWT  
- POST `/user/login` – Authenticate user credentials and return a JWT  
- POST `/user/logout` – Invalidate the current JWT via Redis blacklisting (requires valid JWT)  
- POST `/user/admin/register` – Register a new admin account (admin-only)  
- DELETE `/user/profile` – Delete the authenticated user’s profile  
- GET `/user/check` – Verify the current JWT and return authenticated user data  

### Problem Routes
- POST `/problem/create` – Create a new coding problem (admin-only)  
- PUT `/problem/update/:id` – Update an existing problem by its ID (admin-only)  
- DELETE `/problem/:id` – Delete a problem by its ID (admin-only)  
- GET `/problem/problemById/:id` – Retrieve a specific problem’s details by its ID  
- GET `/problem/getAllProblem` – Retrieve the list of all problems  
- GET `/problem/problemSolvedbyUser` – Get all problems solved by the authenticated user  
- GET `/problem/submittedProblem/:pid` – Get all submissions for problem ID `:pid` by the authenticated user 

### Submission Routes
- POST `/submission/submit/:id` – Submit code for final evaluation (hidden and visible test cases) for problem ID `:id`  
- POST `/submission/run/:id` – Execute code against visible test cases for problem ID `:id`  

### AI Assistance Route
- POST `/ai/chat` – Get AI assistance for coding problems  

### Video Routes
- GET `/video/create/:problemId` – Generate a secure Cloudinary upload signature for problem ID `:problemId` (admin-only)  
- POST `/video/save` – Save video metadata (URL, duration, thumbnail) after upload (admin-only)  
- DELETE `/video/delete/:problemId` – Delete the video associated with problem ID `:problemId` (admin-only)
