- Submission history tracking with performance metrics  

### üö¶ Rate Limiting & Security
- Custom sliding window rate limiting using Redis  
- Protection against DDoS and brute-force attacks  
- Different limits for various operations:  
  - 5 login attempts per 15 minutes  
  - 10 code submissions per minute  
  - Admin operation limits  

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Assistance
- Google Gemini integration for doubt solving  
- Context-aware responses strictly focused on current problem  
- Multiple assistance modes (hints, code review, solutions)  
- Beautifully formatted code responses with dark theme  

### üé• Video Solutions
- Cloudinary integration for video storage  
- Direct frontend upload with secure signed requests

## üóÇÔ∏è API Structure


### Authentication Routes
- POST `/user/register` ‚Äì Register a new user and issue a JWT  
- POST `/user/login` ‚Äì Authenticate user credentials and return a JWT  
- POST `/user/logout` ‚Äì Invalidate the current JWT via Redis blacklisting (requires valid JWT)  
- POST `/user/google-auth` ‚Äì Authenticate with Google OAuth token and return JWT
- POST `/user/admin/register` ‚Äì Register a new admin account (admin-only)  
- DELETE `/user/profile` ‚Äì Delete the authenticated user‚Äôs profile  
- GET `/user/check` ‚Äì Verify the current JWT and return authenticated user data  

### Problem Routes
- POST `/problem/create` ‚Äì Create a new coding problem (admin-only)  
- PUT `/problem/update/:id` ‚Äì Update an existing problem by its ID (admin-only)  
- DELETE `/problem/:id` ‚Äì Delete a problem by its ID (admin-only)  
- GET `/problem/problemById/:id` ‚Äì Retrieve a specific problem‚Äôs details by its ID  
- GET `/problem/getAllProblem` ‚Äì Retrieve the list of all problems  
- GET `/problem/problemSolvedbyUser` ‚Äì Get all problems solved by the authenticated user  
- GET `/problem/submittedProblem/:pid` ‚Äì Get all submissions for problem ID `:pid` by the authenticated user 

### Submission Routes
- POST `/submission/submit/:id` ‚Äì Submit code for final evaluation (hidden and visible test cases) for problem ID `:id`  
- POST `/submission/run/:id` ‚Äì Execute code against visible test cases for problem ID `:id`  

### AI Assistance Route
- POST `/ai/chat` ‚Äì Get AI assistance for coding problems  

### Video Routes
- GET `/video/create/:problemId` ‚Äì Generate a secure Cloudinary upload signature for problem ID `:problemId` (admin-only)  
- POST `/video/save` ‚Äì Save video metadata (URL, duration, thumbnail) after upload (admin-only)  
- DELETE `/video/delete/:problemId` ‚Äì Delete the video associated with problem ID `:problemId` (admin-only)  

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)  
- MongoDB  
- Redis  
- Cloudinary account  
- Judge0 API access  
- Google Gemini API key 
- Google Cloud Console project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
### Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Create a .env file with the following variables:

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
JUDGE0_API_URL=your_judge0_api_url
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key      
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id


### Key Dependencies
- `express` - Web framework
- `mongoose` - MongoDB ODM  
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT implementation
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `redis` - Caching and rate limiting
- **`google-auth-library` - Google OAuth verification**
- `validator` - Input validation
- `axios` - HTTP client for Judge0 API
- `cloudinary` - Video storage

### Authentication Methods
1. **Traditional Email/Password:** Users register with email and password
2. **Google OAuth:** Users sign in with their Google account
   - Frontend sends Google credential token to `/user/google-auth`
   - Backend verifies token with Google's servers  
   - Creates new user if first-time, or logs in existing user
   - Returns JWT for subsequent API calls
   
## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- WebSocket integration for real-time collaboration
- Enhanced admin dashboard with analytics
- Problem categories and tags for better organization
- User rankings and leaderboards
- contest feature integration
- Social features (following, sharing solutions)
